# Inventory-Updater
A windows program to parse specifically formatted excel files, edit the useful data, and output text files for import into ECRS Catapult.

### Why?
While performing IT work for a company, our department received frequent price updates.  To make sure mistakes were not made, I created a windows program that would take a batch of excel sheets, check for errors, and then display all the information.  The data could be verified as one whole unit and then exported into CSV files for import into our database.  This also saved our department a lot of time since the data was reduced to just one list and one set of imports.
